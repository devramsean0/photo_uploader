# Photo Uploader
A quick tool, mostly meant for myself that will do the following:
- Scans a direcory
- Extracts the EXIF data from all the .pngs and .jpgs
- Watermarks in the corner with
    - Camera Name (or fallback)
    - Date (if avaliable)
    - Time (if avaliable)
- Creates an immich album by name if it does not exist
- Uploads the watermarked assets to that album
